        <p>
            Hi, Im Keegan. A 4th year transfer Game Design and Development student. My interests are in character and
            environmental art, and music. I enjoy drawing and modeling and I have a vinyl record collection. I hope to
            be able to build my own portfolio page by the end of this class. Or at least be close to finishing, and have
            the skills to do so. After graduating I would ideally like to find a Tech Artist role at a studio. I've
            learned to like a decent portion of the programming process, but my heart is still in art and would like
            that to be my larger focus moving into the future.
        </p>
