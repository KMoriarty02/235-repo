        All other images and models used were created by me.

    <h2>Goal for site</h2>
    <p>I would like for this to serve as a personal portfolio moving forward.<br>
    Thus I wanted to keep the design simplistic while showing information immediately.<br>
    Thats why I added the recent works section, so that someone, for instance a client or recruiter viewing doesnt need to go searching for things off the bat.

    <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
    <p>- Added some icons using the fontawesome framework<br>
        - Made it so that images increase in size a bit when hovered. Would like to add the ability to click on images and have them enlarge further and show details.
        But I dont think I know JS well enough to accomplish that yet.<br>
        - Made it so the Works links go to additional pages on the site, though those arent built out quite yet. Just want to display the functionality.<br>
        - Theres a lot of cool stuff that I would like to keep building on this site with that heavily utilizes JS (specifically Next.JS.)
        But for now Im quite pleased with the homepage.<br>
        - Would like to add the ability to add/remove art down the line without having to edit the html.<br>
        - Was having troubles getting the models to import with their textures. The functionality to import them was left commented out in the code to show the attempt was made.<br>
        - Was having issues with my import of three.js. It seems like something went wrong with my install from the terminal. 
        Most of the functionality required was there. But that likely explains why I couldnt use some of the additional feature and perhaps why textures werent working. Due to the import of the GLTFLoader being incomplete.<br>
        - I plan to continue developing this site beyond this class. Utilizing other frameworks to make it flow better.<br>
        - The most prominent thing that I want to add is the ability to click on an image and have it pullup an overlaying view were it is larger and has information about the work displayed under it within that overlay.
