    <p>I dont have a direct link for the background image. But it is free to use under Unsplash's liscense.<br>
        Credit goes to Alexandr Sadkov<br><br>
        All other images used were created by me.

    <h2>Goal for site</h2>
    <p>I would like for this to serve as a personal portfolio moving forward.<br>
    Thus I wanted to keep the design simplistic while showing information immediately.<br>
    Thats why I added the recent works section, so that someone, for instance a client or recruiter viewing doesnt need to go searching for things off the bat.

    <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
    <p>Added some icons using the fontawesome framework<br>
        Made it so that images increase in size a bit when hovered. Would like to add the ability to click on images and have them enlarge further and show details.
        But I dont think I know JS well enough to accomplish that yet.<br>
        Made it so the Works links go to additional pages on the site, though those arent built out quite yet. Just want to display the functionality.<br>
        Theres a lot of cool stuff that I would like to keep building on this site with that heavily utilizes JS (specifically Next.JS.)
        But for now Im quite pleased with the homepage.<br>
        Would like to add the ability to add/remove art down the line without having to edit the html.
